<h1>Answers</h1>

<h2>Creating an Idea, Incubated Idea or Project</h2>

<h3><a id="create-ans1">Do I have to choose a project name?</a></h3>
<p>The 'Project Name' gives identity to the project just the same as branding a product. Ideally it would be unique to avoid confusion with anything else and certainly should not use a name that is protected or owned by a legal entity, e.g. as in a trademark. Just as with branding the name chosen can impact the acceptance and how memorable the project is. In Realise's 3 stages the project name can change from one stage to the next or indeed once the project is independent of Realise. Idea names are the most likely to change as many idea's may become a single incubator.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans2">How do I create an idea?</a></h3>
<p>Navigate to the Ideas Lab and chose an idea title and select 'submit' idea. Additional information will be requested. Further instructions can be found on the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans3">How do I create an incubated idea?</a></h3>
<p>An incubated idea is developed from a current idea. To incubate an idea, select it, then select 'incubate'. Further instructions can be found on the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans4">How do I create a project?</a></h3>
<p>Projects are created from incubated ideas once they have an 'openness rating' of 75% or more. To begin the 'openness rating' select the incubated idea manage page and select 'Get an openness rating'. Further instructions can be found on the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans6">What is a Project URL?</a></h3>
<p>A URL is a web address seen in the address bar of most browsers. In todays world the way to make most people aware of the project and to find out what is happening is through the Internet so a project online presence, through at least a webpage, is important. Ultimately blogs for the project community to share and discuss things are also important. In Realise at some point during the incubator stage there should be a separate online presence, i.e. an independent webpage at least.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans7">Why do I  need to leave a contact name?</a></h3>
<p>When choosing to get fully involved in an open community  its useful for everyone in the community to know who you are. In Realise only named people associated with an Incubator or project stage entry have to provide their name. This is because the named people will be seen as leading the activity.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="create-ans8">Why do I  need to leave a contact e-mail?</a></h3>
<p>When choosing to get fully involved in an open community activity beyond knowing who you are its important that people can contact you. For any online activity the most obvious way to do this is through e-mail. Realise again expects people who lead incubator and project stage activities to provide this.</p>

<h2>Idea and project management</h2>

<h3><a id="mang-ans1">Can I delete comments made about my idea, incubated idea or project page?</a></h3>
<p>Comments can be deleted by selecting the delete icon <img src="/presentation/images/slash-button.png" original-title="Delete icon"> on the right of a posted comment if you are the manager of the project. When an administer comments on an idea or project that comment cannot be deleted except by another administrator.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="mang-ans2">Can I delete an idea?</a></h3>
<p>You cannot delete any ideas, even your own. If you would like one removed please contact our web administrator. Contact details are on the <a href="/contact">contact us</a> page.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="mang-ans3">Can anyone comment on ideas, incubated ideas and projects?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, anyone can comment on ideas, incubated ideas and projects.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="mang-ans4">Can anyone vote on ideas or follow incubated ideas and projects?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, anyone can vote on ideas or follow incubated ideas and projects.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="mang-ans5">How do I become a team member?</a></h3>
<p>To become a team member you must be following an incubated idea or project. The team leader may then offer you the chance to become a team member.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="mang-ans6">How do I create an openness rating?</a></h3>
<p>To create an openness rating select manage on your incubated or project page. Follow the openness rating link at the top of the page and complete the openness rating form. Further instructions can be found on the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<br />
<h2>Legal issues</h2>
<h3><a id="leg-ans1">Who can use the software?</a></h3>
<p>Everyone and anyone who has agreed to the terms of the licence(s) should have permission to run the software. Open source software is released under a licence so while it may appear to users that its simply 'free' it typically isn't free of some conditions. (<a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/beginners.xml">What is open source software?</a>)</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans2">Can I see the source code of the software?/ Who can see the program?</a></h3>
<p>Of Realise itself, just those granted access by the project leadership. But for incubated projects or actual projects hosted on Realise then all members of the community.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans3">Can I edit the software code?/Who can edit the source code?</a></h3>
<p>If the only person or people who can edit the program code is the original programmer(s) then the project is not 'open source' at all.  One of the main positive features of an open source program is that many people can be working to improve it or adding features. That is when one individual or group improves the program through adding open code, all the other community users and indeed developers obtain that improvement for free. The fewer programmers who can join in in improving the program the less likely is it that this benefit will happen and the less open the project is.  And, so the more programmers (coders) who can see the source code the better. (see <href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/iprguide.xml">OSS Watch ownership and licensing pages</a>)</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans4">Can I share the software with other people?/Who can give copies of the software to other people?</a></h3>
<p>If the only people who can redistribute modified or unmodified source code are the originators of the code this at least restricts the open, i.e. freely sharing, nature of open strategies. At a minimal level any restrictions will introduce more administration and management for those allowed to redistribute. At its worst restrictions could strangle access to the code to a single channel.( see <href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/iprguide.xml">OSS Watch ownership and licensing pages</a></p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans5">What are common Free and Open Source Licences?</a></h3>
<p>Just like all software, open source software must be supplied with a license. To prevent thousands or more varieties of licenses being used two organisations (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a> and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a>) have good open license examples that anyone can use. These licenses help to make sure that the permission to use the software is open and that because the license is recognised people in the know can instantly understand the terms and conditions of use. Please contact <a href="http://www.opendirective.com/">Open Directive</a> or <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/licdiff.xml">OSS Watch</a>.</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans6">What are project dependencies and licence compatibilities?</a></h3>
<p>Project dependencies can be collections of code that need to be noted as belonging to someone or an organisation and the fact that they come with a licence for use which is compatible with the licence you are using for your project - see <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/iprguide.xml">OSS Watch ownership and licensing pages</a></p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans7">Who is allowed to view my project's source code?</a></h3>
<p>If the only person or people who can see the program code in its human readable form are owners, e.g. original programmer(s) then the project is not 'open source' at all but 'closed'.  Programmers and sometimes others need to be able to see the code of the program to have a chance to make use of, add to or improve the code. This would be some-what open but if anyone can see the code and it is available for others to change say on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Source Forge</a> then it is more likely to be Open source but there may still be legal issues that need to be addressed (see <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/iprguide.xml">OSS Watch ownership and licensing pages</a>)</a></p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="leg-ans8">Can other people license your software under a different licence or can you change a licence on a piece of software that you want to develop further?</a></h3>
<p>If a piece of software has already been licensed say under a GPL v2 type licence - then the answer would be 'no' but there are licences that allow for sub-licensing and others with caveats so please ask an expert as copyright and intellectual property rights are at stake.  Please contact <a href="http://www.opendirective.com/">Open Directive</a> or <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/licdiff.xml">OSS Watch</a> and check the <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml">OSS Watch Contributor Licence Agreements</a></p>

<h2>Access information</h2>

<h3><a id="acc-ans1">Can I see all the information on the project?/Who can see all the information on the project?</a></h3>
<p>Members of the community - anyone who visits the site</p>
<div class="answer"></div>

<h3><a id="acc-ans2">Are there any reasons why access isn't free?/ Can I use the software for any purpose?</a></h3>
<p>Realise is required to consider how to make sure it can continue to exist after its original funding. This means that some of the knowledge may have to used to generate income. For Realise incubator and project software normally the aim is not to have any. But if some hardware is involved then this cannot be free.</p>
