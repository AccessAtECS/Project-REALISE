	7.	Are there any reasons why access isn't free?/ Can I use the software for any purpose?
	?	Realise is required to consider how to make sure it can continue to exist after its original funding. This means that some of the knowledge may have to used to generate income. For Realise incubator and project software normally the aim is not to have any. But if some hardware is involved then this cannot be free.
