		<h2>The Idea Lab</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Ideas page. If you have an Idea that you want to share with the community, please write a brief overview of your idea in the box below. Once you select 'Submit', you may fill in more details about your idea. Once this is done, contact your friends and colleague, see what they think, ask for comments to help your idea begin its journey. If enough people show an interest in an idea and someone wants to take the idea forward it can be changed and move into what we have called the 'incubator'. Please note that you must be registered to submit an idea.</p>
