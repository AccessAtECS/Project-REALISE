<h1>Who is REALISE for?</h1>
<p>
If you have an idea that would make using the Internet, computers and mobile devices easier for those who struggle with their use - then REALISE is for you. It is aimed at users, carers, developers, businesses, key researchers, assistive technology specialists and all those willing to contribute.

			<h2>What is an idea in REALISE?</h2>
			<p>An idea can be anything from someone saying "I need help with a problem" to someone suggesting a solution. Other people can then comment on the idea. If enough people show an interest in an idea and someone wants to take the idea forward it can be changed and move into what we have called the 'incubator'.</p>

		<h2>What is an incubated idea in REALISE?</h2>
		<p>In the incubator a group with a possible leader tries to get an idea turned into a project. To do this one or more developers design a solution whilst working with those who submitted an idea or problem. The incubator also allows for open discussion on the idea, so that it may be turned into a fully-fledged project in future.</p>
		<p>Researchers may show their interest by suggesting and developing solutions and by offering to collect evidence that solutions do in fact work.</p>

	<div class="hidden">
		<h2>What is a project in REALISE?</h2>
		<p>Once an Incubated Idea is approved, your idea will then officially become a project. The projects will normally be open and have their own on-line website and network of interested people, especially those trialling the outcomes. At any stage commercial companies or researchers can become involved in the project and help further its progress. Agreements can then be made with those companies, which can be kept to until the end of the project.</p>
