		<h2>The Incubator</h2>
		<p>The incubator is for ideas that have the potential to be a project. Here the idea can be developed using suggestions from any user. For your incubated idea to become a project, it must have an openness rating of 75% or more. The openness rating system was developed by <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/">OSS Watch</a> to ensure projects are open source. Should your incubated idea achieve this then it can become a project.</p>
